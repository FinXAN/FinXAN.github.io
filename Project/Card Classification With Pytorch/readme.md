# Overview  
Transfer learning based on a pretrained model, ResNet50, is used in this case. Feel free to use any other models. The dataset is chosen from [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification). You can also use other datasets by changing the import path.

# Data Structure  
The most common and widely used dataset structure is shown below. A Visio graph illustrates the format.

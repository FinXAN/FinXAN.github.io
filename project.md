# My Projects

Welcome to the Projects page! Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

## 1. YOLO on Raspberry Pi

### Overview:
The **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection algorithm is implemented on a **Raspberry Pi** in this project. The goal is to enable real-time vehicle detection and tracking, optimized for a low-power edge device like the Raspberry Pi. YOLO's efficiency makes it suitable for real-time applications, and this project demonstrates its ability to detect objects in a live video feed with minimal computational resources.

### Key Features:
- Real-time object detection with YOLO on a Raspberry Pi.
- Optimized for performance on low-cost, low-power devices.
- Used **Python** and **OpenCV** for real-time image processing.

### Tools Used:
- **Raspberry Pi 4**
- **YOLOv4** (You Only Look Once - Object Detection Algorithm)
- **OpenCV**
- **Python**

## 2. Card Classification with PyTorch

### Overview:
In this project, I developed a **card classification model** using **PyTorch**. The objective was to classify different types of cards (such as playing cards or business cards) based on their images. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to achieve high classification accuracy. The deep learning model was built using a custom architecture, leveraging PyTorchâ€™s flexibility for experimentation.

### Key Features:
- Classifies different types of cards using deep learning.
- Implements data preprocessing and augmentation for image datasets.
- Trains a custom neural network model using PyTorch.

### Tools Used:
- **PyTorch**
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing
- **Python**
- **NumPy**

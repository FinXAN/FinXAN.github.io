# My Projects

Welcome to the Projects page! Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

## 1. YOLO on Raspberry Pi

### Overview:
The **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection algorithm is implemented on a **Raspberry Pi** in this project. The goal is to track the train timetable from Manchester Oxford Station to Piccadilly Station
### Key Features:
- Optimized for performance on low-cost, low-power devices.
- Used **Python** and **OpenCV** for real-time image processing.

### Tools Used:
- **Raspberry Pi 4**
- **YOLOv11n** (You Only Look Once - Object Detection Algorithm)
- **OpenCV**
- **Python**

For the full project and code, check out the [GitHub repository](./Project/Yolo on Rasberry/index.md).

## 2. Card Classification with PyTorch
### Overview:

In this project, I developed a **card classification model** using **PyTorch**. The objective was to classify different styles of cards their images. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to achieve high classification accuracy. The deep learning model was built using a custom architecture, leveraging PyTorchâ€™s flexibility for experimentation.

### Key Features:
- Classifies different types of cards using deep learning.
- Implements data preprocessing and augmentation for image datasets.
- Trains a custom neural network model using PyTorch.

### Tools Used:
- **PyTorch**
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
